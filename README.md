# MyWeatherApp
## This is a weather application i build using HTML CSS AND JAVASCRIPT using API from openweather for weather
parameters/city and pexel for images/city.
## I also implemented a search history function, that stores history of the weather from different cities searched
in the local storage in an array which is then fetch and populate the select option of the view.
