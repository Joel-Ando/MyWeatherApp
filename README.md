# Weather Application

This weather application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, utilizing APIs from OpenWeather for weather parameters by city and Pexels for city images.

## Features

- **Weather Information**: Get real-time weather information for cities worldwide, including temperature, weather conditions, and more.

- **Search History**: The application keeps track of your search history, storing the weather data for different cities in local storage as an array. You can easily revisit previous searches without retyping the city names.

## APIs Used

- **OpenWeather API**: Provides weather data based on city names.

- **Pexels API**: Fetches images of cities to display as backgrounds based on search results.

## How to Use

1. **Search for Weather**:
   - Enter the name of a city in the input field.
   - Click the "Search" button to retrieve weather information.
   - The weather details will be displayed, including temperature, weather conditions, and a city image background.

2. **Search History**:
   - As you search for different cities, your search history is automatically saved.
   - To revisit a previous search, open the dropdown menu and select a city from the history list and the weather details for the selected city will be displayed.

## Installation

No installation is required. Simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser to start using the application.
